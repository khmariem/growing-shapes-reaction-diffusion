Some of the results obtained by using Reaction-Diffusion equations together with various parameter combinations to obtain different patterns. The results are both for 3D meshes and 2D grids.
In these examples, we show the patterns formed after thousands of iterations. These patterns depend on the **feed** and **kill** parameters for the same morphogens **A** and **B** initialization.

## 2D Grids:
Here, we showcase the start and an intermediate step from the reaction-diffusion process:
